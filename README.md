# ORun - Data field for Garmin Connect IQ

A custom orienteering data-field for Garmin Connect IQ devices.

ORun gives you current bearing, straight line distance and altitude from the last "reference" waypoint.<br>
Pressing 'start' or 'lap' sets the current reference waypoint.<br>

With ORun you can quickly find your current location on any physical map given that the "reference" waypoint was a known location.<br>
ORun is not allowed on orienteering competitions but can be a useful tool during orienteering training or when just hiking with a map.<br>

ORun is designed for a "1 field layout" watch-page but displays 9 fields of information.<br>
Supported devices; Fenix 3/HR, 5/5x, 6/6pro/6xpro, 7,7x, Fr920xt, Fr735xt, Fr630, Fr235, Fr230 and Vivoactive.<br>
Minimum requirement: Connect IQ, Aikido v1.3
